## About me
My name is Jack, I am 27 years old, and I was born right here in Raleigh NC

### My interests

*PC Gaming

*Watching video essays on Youtube

*Looking up any little questions I have on Reddit

### Favorite websites
*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)- I have spend so much time seeing what people have to say about topics I care about

*[Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com/en/)- Definitely one of the best places to get pc games on sale legitimately

*[isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/)- If one place doesn't have the deal you're looking for maybe another one will! All websites are vetted first so you don't have to worry about buying a stolen key

*[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)- This one goes without saying. If you have any question, no matter how big or small, there is an answer for it here. Reddit has taught me so many skills I use. From finding out whats wrong with my vehicle, what treats are safe for my dog to eat, and figuring out why my computer wont turn on
